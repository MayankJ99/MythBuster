## Programming Myth Buster Hub
#### WIP

### Objectives

- A platform where Programmers can post topics or opinions to be discussed and scrutinized. For example:
    - "GNU C++ compilation is less memory intensive than GNU Rust w/ LLVM".
    - "Javascript does not differentiate between float and integer types at runtime"


### Features

- User accounts
    - Tracks previous posts made by a user
    - User "track record" for quality of posts and responses
- Public topics may be created using text, videos, images, and other multimedia
    - Public topics may include the "goal post" of proving or debunking the myth
- Responses to public topics may be created using text, videos, images, and other multimedia
- Responses may be voted on as to whether or not the community accepts the response as an answer that meets the requirements of proving or debunking the myth
- Topics may be categorized


### Target Audience

- Intermediate programmers, self-taught and in University
    - When a programmer is in their learning stage, jumping from language to language and framework to framework, they have to swim through an ocean of facts, opinions, and lies which may be difficult to discern.
    - An archive of facts may be build related to these programming myths that may be referenced when discussing or deciding between languages and frameworks


- Experienced Developers
    - Experienced developers may be provided with a platform to discuss and document these topics that have been up for debate in the programming community.
